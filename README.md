## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Rui Belo.

### Bio

I'm certified in **front web development**, and I currently reside in Manchester, United Kingdom.

In my childhood, **my favourite hobby was Lego.** I loved the challenge of building complex constructions from a bunch of blocks of different colours, shapes and sizes.  

The Lego hobby has helped me to develop **skills such as patience, organization, and methodical**, skills that have been very useful in my personal and professional life.

I've been interested in programming since I was very young, and I became a **programmer/administrator of Oracle and MS SQL databases.**

Programming is like building Lego, from an idea, connecting all the blocks with the ultimate goal of creating something that will be useful to someone.

>**Putting things together and making them work that's my passion.**

I am always striving to improve my skills and my knowledge base.  
I consider **communication** and **collaboration** are **key parts of teamwork.**

When I'm not programming, I like to spend time with my family, travelling or listening to music.
